# Housing-Price-Prediction
# Boston Houses Price Prediction
I am happy to share the House Price Prediction Machine Learning Project using Python. In this project, the XGboost regression algorithm is used.

Data is about Boston USA Housing prices that contain 500 rows and 14 columns (features).

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful and efficient machine-learning algorithm based on decision trees. It is widely used for supervised learning tasks such as regression, classification, and ranking due to its speed, performance, and scalability. XGBoost implements a gradient-boosting framework and is particularly effective in handling structured/tabular data.

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗫𝗚𝗕𝗼𝗼𝘀𝘁:
Performance: Highly optimized for speed and resource efficiency.
Regularization: Includes L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
Parallelization: Supports parallel processing for faster training.
Flexibility: Can handle missing data, and supports custom loss functions.
Scalability: Works efficiently with large datasets.
Tree Pruning: Uses a "max depth" parameter and "loss-guided" pruning for better generalization.
Cross-validation: Supports built-in cross-validation during training.

𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀:
Predictive modeling (price predictions, risk assessment)
Classification tasks (fraud detection, medical diagnoses)
Ranking problems (search engines, recommendation systems)
Time series forecasting

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀:
data Collection
data preprocessing
Data Validation
Data Skewness Check
Exploratory Data Analysis
Model fitting
Model Training-testing
Model Valuation
Accuracy score check.


𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 We checked that the model was a good fit and the score was also well and we can see price predictions on labeling features data. This project gave me a clear picture of XGboost which is powerful.
